About
A career built on
keeping clients
I'm a Customer Success executive with 10+ years building and scaling enterprise CS programs across global BPO platforms, remote staffing solutions, and Fortune 500 enterprise account management — with a track record of making the invisible visible before churn intent forms.

My approach treats customer risk as two distinct profiles: vocal dissatisfaction requiring rapid containment, and quiet disengagement requiring behavioral signal detection. Building the dual-lane health scoring systems that address both is where I do my best work — and where my results live: 18% churn reduction, $4.2M ARR protected, 32-point NPS improvement.

I've built CS programs from scratch, led teams of 4 to 20, managed 200+ enterprise accounts, and operated remote-first since 2020. My MS in Business Analytics from Syracuse University underpins every health score, dashboard, and retention framework I've built.

Retail Distribution
Director of Customer Success & Strategic Partnerships
Built the organization's first formal CS program from the ground up — architecting a dual-lane health scoring system that distinguishes vocal dissatisfaction from quiet disengagement, and deploying distinct response motions for each risk profile across a 200+ account Fortune 500 portfolio.

Built and lead a team of 4 CS associates and 2 ops coordinators — improving team SLA compliance from 74% to 96% through weekly coaching, KPI scorecards, and monthly calibration sessions
Designed a 30-60-90 onboarding framework with milestone-based checkpoints and GRR/NRR baseline documentation — reducing average onboarding completion time 30% and improving early-stage CSAT
Facilitated executive QBRs with VP and C-suite stakeholders at Walmart, Kroger, Jewel-Osco, Meijer, Safeway & Albertsons — achieving 100% renewal rate on top-tier accounts

Let's build something together
I'm actively exploring Director-level Customer Success and Client Experience roles — ideally remote-first, at a B2B SaaS, BPO, HR tech, or remote staffing company where CS is positioned as a revenue function, not a support cost.
